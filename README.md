"How did I sleep" is a web app that connects to my Fitbit and displays my sleep data in a simple and easy to understand way.

I haven't implemented error handling for if my Fitbit didn't managed to track all the required sleep stats for the previous night, so if I didn't sleep the right way last night some values might not show up properly or might appear as "undefined."
